#  MkDocs 
Project documentation with Markdown

---


## Overview

MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

---
**MkDocs is currently still in development.**

We're progressing quickly, but the documentation still needs filling in, and there are a few rough edges. The 1.0 release is planned to arrive in the next few months.
