<h1> Configuration</h1>
---

### Introduction

Project settings are configured by default using a YAML configuration file in the project directory named mkdocs.yml. You can specify another path for it by using the -f/--config-file option (see mkdocs build --help).

### Project information

site_name
This is a required setting, and should be a string that is used as the main title for the project documentation. For example:

```
site_name: Marshmallow Generator
```
