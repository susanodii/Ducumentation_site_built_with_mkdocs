## Requirements
MkDocs requires a recent version of Python and the Python package manager, pip, to be installed on your system.

You can check if you already have these installed from the command line:
```
$ python --version
Python 3.8.2
$ pip --version
pip 20.0.2 from /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)
```

## Installing Python
Install Python using your package manager of choice, or by downloading an installer appropriate for your system from python.org and running it.




## Installing pip

If you're using a recent version of Python, the Python package manager, pip, is most likely installed by default. However, you may need to upgrade pip to the lasted version:
```
pip install --upgrade pip

```
If you need to install pip for the first time, download get-pip.py. Then run the following command to install it:
```
python get-pip.py

```
