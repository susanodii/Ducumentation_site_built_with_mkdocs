<h1>Choosing your Theme</h1>
---
MkDocs includes two built-in themes (mkdocs and readthedocs), as documented below. However, many third party themes are available to choose from as well.

To choose a theme, set the theme configuration option in your mkdocs.yml config file.

```
theme:
    name: readthedocs
```
