<h1> Localizing Your Theme</h1>
---

### Installation

For theme localization to work, you must use a theme which supports it and enable i18n (internationalization) support by installing mkdocs[i18n]:
```
pip install mkdocs[i18n]
```

### Supported locales

In most cases a locale is designated by the ISO-639-1 (2-letter) abbreviation for your language. However, a locale may also include a territory (or region or county) code as well. The language and territory must be separated by an underscore. For example, some possible locales for English might include en, en_AU, en_GB, and en_US.

For a list of locales supported by the theme you are using, see that theme's documentation.
