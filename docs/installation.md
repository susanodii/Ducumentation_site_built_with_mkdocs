<h1> MkDocs Installation</h1>
---

### Requirements

MkDocs requires a recent version of Python and the Python package manager, pip, to be installed on your system.

You can check if you already have these installed from the command line:
```
$ python --version
Python 3.8.2
$ pip --version
pip 20.0.2 from /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)
```

If you already have those packages installed, you may skip down to Installing MkDocs.

If you are installing Python on Windows, be sure to check the box to have Python added to your PATH if the installer offers such an option (it's normally off by default).
